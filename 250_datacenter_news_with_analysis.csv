Data centers store and manage the digital information that drives modern society. Supporters say the centers are boons for economic development . Opponents say the centers hog land, water and power, potentially driving utility prices higher and quality of life lower . Demand also is booming for data center property, particularly around metro Atlanta . Rural Columbia County residents for the past several months have voiced strong public objections to a proposed plan to expand White Oak Business Park off Appling-Harlem Highway to add an 8.1-million-square-foot data center. Now, two more data center projects are waiting in the queue. Eleven land parcels totaling 944.27 acres are being proposed for Byrd Farms Technology Campus. The area is bordered roughly by I-20 to the south, Lonergan Hulme Road to the west, Louisville Road to the east, and Langston Avenue to the north. The project ""is designed to attract high-value, low-impact economic growth, enhancing local infrastructure and employment opportunities while minimizing its footprint on the surrounding community,"" according to the Dec. 5 narrative accompanying the rezoning applications. Applicant Byrd Farms LLC said it has been ""working with the Byrd family, Grand Oak Farms, and a number of other longtime owners."" The project's ""modeling assumptions"" for onsite noise tests described a campus composed of 18 one-story buildings of 275,000 square feet each. Another data center development is being proposed south of Exit 184, near Pumpkin Center. Applicant Piedmont DevCo LLC, represented by the Prather family developing nearby Greenpoint, is proposing to establish the Pumpkin Technology Campus on about 420 acres of land. The campus would be bordered on three sides roughly by I-20, Appling-Harlem Highway, and Wrightsboro Road, according to DevCo's rezoning application. A map showing the project's concept plan shows a campus including four data center buildings, each measuring 717,600 square feet, two 180,000-square-foot warehouses, and a proposed power substation. The project's narrative ""envisions a discreet yet highly productive development valued at well over $1 billion."" The Columbia County Board of Commissioners voted Dec. 2 to pass a new section of the county's zoning ordinance specifically to govern data centers. Some residents implied that county leaders had been pursuing the White Oak proposal with developer Trammell Crow for the past several months.

(WRDW/WAGT) - Two newly proposed data centers in Columbia County would add to the growing data center development in the area. These are in addition to ? and near ? the site of a huge one that’s already been proposed and drawn opposition from some neighbors. Columbia County leaders want to create a specialized zoning district for data centers that will help them get approved faster. According to zoning documents, the proposed Byrd Farms Data Center calls for 18 one-story data center buildings just before the White Oak Business Park. If approved, it would take up 944 acres of land on Lonergan Hulme Road and Nature’s Way. The other newly proposed site, the Pumpkin Center Data Center, could go along Appling Harlem Highway as well and would take up 420 acres of land. The developer says the data center would employ 200-300 workers. These proposed data centers are not approved yet. They still have to go through an approval process with the planning commission and board of commissioners. The newly proposed data centers are in addition to another data center a company wants to build at the White Oak Business Park. Columbia County leaders say they are confident that project will move forward. Officials say it would bring in about $118 million in revenue to the county. Meanwhile, two incoming Georgia Public Service Commission members are pushing to stop the rate-regulatuing panel from approving a plan that would allow Georgia Power to add 10,000 megawatts to the state’s power supply. Most of that energy is intended to power data centers. The commissioners warn that approving the plan could leave regular customers paying for billions in power that the state might not need. A crucial vote is scheduled for Friday. State Superintendent of Education Ellen Weaver wants to cap the amount of money a local district superintendent can receive when they leave their job. The opposition comes as public sentiment toward data centers has grown increasingly negative in many communities. “And just like affecting the overall livelihood for people from day to day, from noise pollution to light pollution to skyrocketing our utility bills,” said Isabella Tallman-Jones. Across the river in South Carolina, one community learned that nine data centers and two substations could take over property zoned for rural development in Colleton County, near the coast. County leaders there say the data centers will provide new jobs and will meet all requirements. The discussion is expected to continue well into the new year. Copyright 2025 WRDW/WAGT.

According to Amazon, the facility is expected to bring high-skilled jobs and long-term economic impacts to the Covington and larger Newton County community. The company thanked community leaders for their support in moving the project forward, adding that it was part of a recent $11 billion investment in Georgia. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks ] “This new project is expected to generate significant new tax revenues to support local priorities such as schools, public safety, and infrastructure, creating meaningful benefits for the community. We are also proud of our water innovations as part of this project, which limits water usage to only 6% of the year, with the remaining 94% relying on only outside air for cooling,” Amazon spokeswoman Simone Griffin told Channel 2 Action News. “In addition, we are funding and building a first-of-its-kind reclaimed water system that will help preserve over 45 million gallons of freshwater annually once operational.” RELATED STORIES: During discussion by members of the Covington City Council, city leaders said the method for the first-of-its-kind water system would make it so the data center does not impact the potable water system at all. That means it is not expected to have an effect on the city or county’s drinkable water system, or residential use of it. Members of the city council approved the utility service agreement on Monday. In additional comments from Amazon on the project, the company said the program will treat domestic sewage and use it for the data center’s cooling needs. “Once the system is operational, 100% of the data center’s cooling water will come from reclaimed water,” Amazon said. The facility is expected to preserve 45 million gallons of freshwater annually by 2030. This is also said to be part of Amazon’s goal of being “water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.” Amazon said its web services division, AWS, was 54% to that goal as of 2024.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File) FILE -- A banner hangs during a ceremony announcing a proposed $300 million expansion of Google’s data center operations Tuesday, June 2, 2015, in Lithia Springs, Ga. (AP Photo/David Goldman, file) ATLANTA (AP) — With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes? Or could the utility overbuild and stick other ratepayers with the bill? It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state’s economy and “allow Georgia to contribute to the nation’s focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.” “Given the number of companies interested in doing business in Georgia and the amount of customer load with signed contracts or in advanced discussions, it is important to continue moving forward with support for this great growth opportunity,” company officials said in testimony. But electricity bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize the power demands of technology behemoths. “I think what’s happening in Georgia is in some sense a perfect microcosm of what’s happening nationwide,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase public involvement in utility regulation. “You’re seeing electricity demand grow at the fastest rate in decades, and you’re seeing electricity prices rise at the fastest rate in decades.” Electricity costs were a key issue in last month’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, both data center hot spots. On Tuesday in North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities. In Georgia, the five elected Republicans on the Public Service Commission will decide on Georgia Power’s proposal weeks after voters delivered a stinging rebuke to GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the panel in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July. After hearings next week, commissioners are scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 19. The two new Democrats won’t take office until January and current commissioners denied a request by opponents to postpone the decision until then. Brionte McCorkle of Georgia Conservation Voters, a group that advocates for carbon-free energy and supported the Democrats, fears the vote will be one last gift from the all-Republican commission to Georgia Power. “It would be a slap in the face for the commission to rush through this proposal, and give the power company everything it wants,” said McCorkle “It’s just not listening to what the people have said loud and clear.” Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas. That’s according to an analysis by power consultant Grid Strategies of forecasts filed with federal officials. The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — saying 80% of that would power data centers. That’s in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power. Whether the forecast is accurate and who will pay the bill if data center customers don’t materialize is at the heart of the decision. Commissioners in January adopted rules meant to make sure data centers pay the costs of building new power plants and transmission lines they need. But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs. “The whole argument is premised on the idea that if we get all these new customers, then we can take costs and spread it out over more people and therefore put downward pressure on prices,” Hua said. “Well, if you don’t actually end up getting all those customers and you built all this new infrastructure, then you could see a scenario where you actually drive bills through the roof even more.” The ultimate potential costs are unknown because Georgia Power’s estimates are partially a trade secret that the company won’t release. For example, the $15 billion price tag only covers construction costs for 80% of the current 10,000 megawatt request, and it doesn’t include any of the borrowing costs, which customers must also pay. The price of the 3,000 megawatts approved in 2024 remains entirely secret. Because of the rate freeze, ultimate costs won’t become clear until 2028, the next time commissioners set electricity rates. Public Service Commission staff members who have analyzed the request say Georgia Power will need $3.4 billion a year in additional revenue by 2031, which could equal out to $20 a month for a residential customer. The company replied that such a claim is “flatly incorrect.” “These customers pay upfront the full costs of serving them, commit to long-term contracts, and provide financial guarantees,” said spokesperson Matthew Kent. “That means residential and small business customers are protected from cost increases tied to these projects.” Staff members recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build capacity for new large customers only after they have signed contracts starting with 3,100 megawatts of capacity and up to 7,400 megawatts total for contracts signed by March 16. That recommendation would also allow the commission to avoid approving contracts for some new multibillion-dollar natural gas-fired power plants. Costs for such construction have risen sharply, partly because equipment manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand. The company reacted sharply against that recommendation, saying “it would significantly inhibit” its ability to sign up new data centers, hurt economic development, and reduce the opportunity to lower rates.

Hubbard was elected to the Georgia Public Service Commission, the body that regulates the state’s electric utility. It’s the first time Democrats have won statewide seats in statewide elections in Georgia in nearly two decades. Residents have complained for years about a series of rate hikes from the PSC. But during Hubbard’s campaigning, he noticed another topic coming up again and again with his future constituents. “The number one issue was affordability,” he says. “But a very close second was data centers and the concern around them just sucking up the water, the electricity, the land—and not really paying any taxes.” Georgia has become a hot spot for data center development over the past few years: Some research indicates it’s one of the fastest-growing markets for data center development in the country (thanks, in part, to some generous tax breaks ). It’s also now a nexus for organizing against those same data centers. Community opposition to data centers, a new report finds , is on the rise across the country. And red states, including Georgia and Indiana, are leading this wave of bipartisan opposition. The new report was released by Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a Labs that tracks community opposition to data centers across the country. The company has been keeping eyes on this topic since 2023, and released its first public findings earlier this year. (While 10a Labs does offer risk analysis for AI companies, report author Miquel Vila says that the Data Center Watch project is separate from the company’s main work, and is not paid for by any clients.) But this week’s report finds that the tide has turned sharply in the months since the group’s first public output. The second quarter of this year, the new report finds, represented “a sharp escalation” in data center opposition across the country. Data Center Watch’s first report covered a period from May 2024 to March of 2025; in that period, it found, local opposition had blocked or delayed a total of $64 billion in data center projects (six projects were blocked entirely, while 10 were delayed). But Data Center Watch’s new report found that opposition blocked or delayed $98 billion in projects from March to June of 2025 alone—eight projects, including two in Indiana and Kentucky, were blocked in those three months, while nine were delayed. One of those projects, a $17 billion development in the Atlanta suburbs, was put on hold in May after the county imposed a 180-day moratorium on data center development, following significant pushback from local residents. There are some “methodological caveats” to the new Data Center Watch report, Vila acknowledges. The new report, which is based solely on public documents including media reports, legal filings, and social media, covers a period of time when data center construction in the US exploded: Industry website ConstructConnect estimates that US spending on data construction by August of this year exceeded all spending in 2024. More data center projects may simply mean more communities are reacting to ones coming to their backyards; more media attention on these projects also may juice up opposition. But the sharp increase in other data observed by Data Center Watch between March and June—including nearly 50,000 signatures on petitions opposing specific data centers across the country in that time period—indicates that there has been “a turning point” in the issue, Vila says. “Before, [resistance] was something that could happen,” he says. “Now it seems that it’s very likely that when you are developing [a data center], potentially someone is going to organize.” Hubbard, who won the Georgia PSC seat, isn’t the only political candidate who has had opposition to data centers play a role in their race, nor is Georgia the only battleground. In Virginia, the country’s data center hub, governor-elect Abigail Spanberger said she wanted to have data centers “pay their own way” for power. Last week, climate journalism site Heatmap profiled John McAuliff, a former Biden climate adviser who won his election based in large part on opposition to data centers. Separate polling from Heatmap, also released last week, shows that less than half of Americans from all political persuasions would support a data center. Josh Thomas is a Virginia state delegate from Prince William County, which, the county claims, has the highest concentration of data centers in the world . He introduced multiple bills during the last legislative session to rein in data centers in Virginia, and data center issues figured prominently in his most recent election. (His opponent, a Republican, alleged that Thomas did not go far enough in trying to stop data center sprawl.) Thomas, who won reelection last week, points to the local pushback against the proposed Prince William Digital Gateway, which would put more than 30 data centers on the edge of a national reserve located in the north of the state. A group of homeowners have challenged the project in court, and a judge voided zoning in August, which temporarily halted construction. “The little guy finally won, which rarely happens in any industry, let alone where the Magnificent Ten play,” he says, referring to the US’s biggest tech companies. “I think that rallied people politically in Virginia.” Thomas, like Hubbard, also says he sees a lot of his constituents concerned about how data centers will affect their electricity bill. “People are just a lot more cost-conscious,” he says. Energy bills, Thomas says “are something that was kept relatively static for a number of years.” But in Virginia, electricity load from data centers are helping to drive up utility bills , Thomas says. Both Thomas and Hubbard are Democrats, but opposition to data centers, the Data Center Watch report stresses, has been thoroughly bipartisan. And some national Republican politicians, including Sen. Josh Hawley , Rep. Thomas Massie, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have begun to speak out against them. “People you have got to pay close attention to your local city, county, and state approvals of data centers and demand your water and energy bills be protected!!!” Greene, who has criticized data center expansion for months, posted on X on November 7. Big tech companies have to date made few public statements about pushback to data center projects. While some, like Meta, provide public-facing information on their data centers, others in the industry lean heavily on nondisclosure agreements when building new data centers, providing little to no information to communities about these projects—including which tech companies may be involved. In a statement, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, a leading industry group, said that the industry is continuing to see “significant interest” from communities across the country in hosting data centers and that members are committed to “continued community engagement and stakeholder education,” as well as “being responsible and responsive neighbors in the communities where they operate.” “The US data center industry provides significant benefits to local communities—creating hundreds of thousands of high-wage jobs across the nation, providing billions of dollars in economic investment, and generating significant local, state, and federal tax revenue that helps fund schools, transportation, public safety, and other community priorities,” Diorio said. “All told, US data centers supported 4.7 million jobs and contributed $162 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2023.” The sea change in public sentiment may not be enough to stem the market enthusiasm for data center build-out. While $93 billion in delayed and blocked investments is certainly not a small number, it’s chump change compared to the massive influx of cash from big tech companies that is, analysts say, currently driving the US economy . (Meta alone said last week that it will invest $600 billion into AI infrastructure, including data centers, over the next three years.) And even though some communities are successfully pushing back against data centers, those wins can be temporary. The ruling on the Prince William Digital Gateway, for instance, was stayed in October , allowing construction to resume as the case moves towards trial next year. Still, Thomas has big plans for data center reform in Virginia’s next legislative session, including reintroducing a reform bill of his that passed the legislature in May but was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. “I have Republicans and Democrats coming to me saying, ‘How can we help with this issue? My constituents are talking about it like they never have before,’” he says. “Our coalition of data center reform-minded legislators has just grown to a very large number.” Correction: 11/17/2025, 9:32 am EDT: Misstatementa of how long it's been since Democrats won statewide elections to statewide office and of the area Josh Thomas represents have been corrected.",,"{""article_id"": ""WIRED_2025-12-01_unknown_location"", ""date"": ""2025-12-01"", ""source"": ""WIRED"", ""analysis"": {""stance_score"": 0.02, ""confidence"": 0.4, ""opposition_risk_score"": 27}, ""location"": {""primary"": null, ""secondary"": [], ""geographic_level"": null}, ""stakeholders"": [{""name"": ""Reporter"", ""type"": ""expert"", ""stance"": 0.0, ""influence_weight"": 1.0, ""quote"": null}], ""themes"": {""environmental"": 20, ""economic"": 50, ""infrastructure"": 5, ""land_use"": 25, ""trust"": 0, ""cultural"": 0}, ""mobilization"": {""indicators_present"": [""group_formation"", ""petition"", ""protest""], ""mobilization_score"": 14, ""specific_actions"": [""ERROR: Model call failed: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

Georgia Power’s pipeline of large load economic development projects shrank a net 6 GW from the second quarter to the third quarter to 50.9 GW due to projects that exited, the utility said in a Friday filing with the Georgia Public Service Commission . Around 6.8 GW of new large load projects entered the pipeline, and projects in the pipeline increased their projected load by a total of 1.6 GW, while 14.3 GW of projects exited, Georgia Power said. Georgia Power’s pipeline of near-term large load projects slated for winter of 2028 and 2029 decreased this quarter by 1.4 GW, to a total of 24.4 GW, the report said. “Although the total and large load economic development pipelines have shrunk, the number of commitments to Georgia Power for electric service from large load customers have grown from 26 to 28,” Georgia Power said in the report. Those two new commitments together account for 2.2 GW and bring the utility’s total commitments to 11 GW, the report said, and since last quarter “an additional five customers have broken ground, reflecting an increase in the long-term load from 3,721 MW in Q2 2025 to 7,313 MW in Q3 2025.” Of the 28 committed projects, 18 have broken ground and 10 are pending construction, which “indicates that these large load customers are materializing and making progress without material delays,” the report said. Georgia Power said that in the near-term, “projects that have broken ground represent 6,175 MW of the total 7,800 MW of customer commitments for the winter of 2028/2029.” The utility could not be immediately reached for comment. Testimony filed Nov. 12 on behalf of the commission’s public interest advocacy staff warned that Georgia Power’s residential customers could see their monthly bills increase if the utility completes its planned generation buildout to support new data centers. “The majority of the new generation Georgia Power seeks to certify … is not backed by executed contracts under the new large load framework,” stated the testimony, given by PSC staff members and consulting analysts. “Only about 1,900 MW is supported by such contracts. The rest is speculative and exposes customers to the risk of stranded costs if the anticipated load does not materialize.” The staff testimony noted that the data center segment is “primarily underperforming expectations due to a mixture of lower materialization rates, project cancellations, and delays.” “Since the 2023 IRP Update, thirty-three data center projects with 11,332 MW of announced load have been removed from the pipeline, representing ~55% of all project removals, and ~65% of announced load removed,” the testimony stated. “24% of data center projects that entered the LRM have been removed with an average of five data center projects exiting the pipeline each quarter … It is unclear whether the Company’s model accounts for this level of project removal.”",,"{""article_id"": ""Utility_Dive_2025-12-03_unknown_location"", ""date"": ""2025-12-03"", ""source"": ""Utility Dive"", ""analysis"": {""stance_score"": 0.0, ""confidence"": 0.3, ""opposition_risk_score"": 15}, ""location"": {""primary"": null, ""secondary"": [], ""geographic_level"": null}, ""stakeholders"": [{""name"": ""Reporter"", ""type"": ""expert"", ""stance"": 0.0, ""influence_weight"": 1.0, ""quote"": null}], ""themes"": {""environmental"": 0, ""economic"": 0, ""infrastructure"": 80, ""land_use"": 20, ""trust"": 0, ""cultural"": 0}, ""mobilization"": {""indicators_present"": [], ""mobilization_score"": 0, ""specific_actions"": [""ERROR: Model call failed: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

The Public Service Commission's public interest advocacy staff had previously advised approving only a third of Georgia Power's request for a 10-megawatt expansion. They had argued in November that ratepayers would face ""unreasonable risk"" if the company built its new power plants and no one came to use the energy. But on Wednesday the agency revealed that the staff had negotiated a ""stipulated agreement"" that would authorize nearly everything Georgia Power requested, with some new guarantees for ratepayers. The company wants more capacity so it can sell more energy as it forecasts massive growth in demand from data centers. Those server warehouses that power the internet have been sprouting across the state and devouring energy to enable the computations behind artificial intelligence. The agreement will not be final unless the five elected commissioners, all Republicans, approve it next week. At month's end, two of them will be off the commission, having lost decisively in the November election to two Democrats who campaigned against a series of recent electricity price hikes. One of the incoming commissioners, Peter Hubbard, attended a protest outside the commission offices before Wednesday's hearing, where he said he had just learned about the new agreement revealed earlier in the morning. He said the estimated cost of $17 billion was just the start and that it could rise to $50 billion or even $60 billion during the 45-year lifespan of the power expansion plan. He warned that ""speculative customers"" might not show up if they find better deals in other states, and he said a ""data center bubble"" could pop, leaving ratepayers on the hook for unnecessary power plant construction. The state can provide affordable, clean and reliable energy, said Hubbard, who takes office Jan. 1, ""but we must not lock ourselves into a massively expensive mistake, with the decision made by two commissioners who are just days away from leaving office."" The protest moved indoors for the hearing, but police escorted several back out after they caused a disruption. ""This whole meeting is a sham,"" one man yelled as he exited. ""They've already made a deal."" Nearly 50 members of the public then got to speak. A handful, including a developer and a representative of the Clayton County Chamber of Commerce, backed the expansion, saying economic growth and jobs rely on power. But a representative from DeKalb County read a resolution by the county commission that called on the Public Service Commission to delay its vote to ensure more time to evaluate the impact on local governments, customers, public health and the environment. Ava Trachtenberg, an environmental science student at Emory University, spoke of the impact on the climate of burning more fossil fuel for energy. She said she was concerned that extreme heat, flooding and drought would cause crop failures and political instability. ""I don't know about you,"" she said, ""but I want my future to be livable."" Some were concerned about cost, such as Joshua Tolbert, an energy engineer, who said Georgia Power should only be authorized to build power plants for customers with executed contracts. Satya Vatti, a nurse, said the tentative agreement would let Georgia Power profit from the expanded supply while ratepayers assumed the risk if demand didn't materialize. ""While working people agonize over the necessities they'll be able to afford and which they'll have to cut each month, Georgia Power investors and executives are raking in cash,"" said Vatti, who described herself as a socialist. Records from a November hearing indicate that the commission's public advocacy staff had misgivings about ratepayers absorbing the cost of unrealistic demand forecasts. “Staff's primary recommendation is that the Commission should approve the acquisition of 3,125"" megawatts, the document said. The staff's turnaround Wednesday to support 10 megawatts in new capacity was due in part to a pledge by Georgia Power to calculate rates based on the forecast rather than actual revenue from ""large load"" customers like data centers. The pledge means a ""downward pressure"" for the typical residential customer's rates, amounting to $8.50 a month, said Jeffrey R. Grubb, a director at Georgia Power who testified Wednesday. ""We want to assure the commission and our customers that certification of the requested resources will not change residential customers' rates,"" he said. ""As we have stated before and reiterate here, existing customers will not pay for the cost associated with serving new large load customers."" But that guaranty is only good from 2029 through 2031. Tricia Pridemore, one of the five commissioners scheduled to vote Dec. 19 on Georgia Power's expansion request, said large load ratepayers drive economic development and pump tax revenue into local government. She said she'd heard of one community that was ""retiring"" property taxes because of the income and of others using the proceeds to build schools or waterworks. That is a ""tremendous benefit,"" she said. ""So when these folks up here want to talk about affordability, that's just one more way where that revenue is being put to use at a local level.""

The panel’s non-binding recommendation goes to city council for its consideration on Thursday. At Monday’s meeting City Attorney Scott Robichaux explained the proposed ordinance change was meant to define a data center and provide “reasonable rules that we can put in place if somebody did want to bring a data center to us.” The amendment “is not an approval of data centers,” he repeatedly told the panel of eight commissioners and audience of about 30 citizens at the mid afternoon meeting at City Hall. The proposed requirements include details regarding setbacks, parking, accessory buildings and prohibited facade materials. (Read the text of the proposed zoning amendment on page 29 of this document . Watch a video of the meeting here. ) About half of the citizens in attendance provided public comment, all of it opposed to data centers. They criticized the potential water and electricity demands of data centers and warned of an approaching AI bubble. Port Wentworth resident Debbie Wiley said she would like to see the city ban them. “A single, large data center uses hundreds of thousands to over a million gallons of water per day, primarily for cooling,” she said. “That is permanent year-round demand placed on our municipal water system, competing directly with residents, fire protection and future growth.” LaRay Benton had some of the same concerns. “Even if you use city water to cool it, what you’re doing is you’re taking away the water capacity that the city now has to improve commercial, retail, other hospitality, but some of the other residential development that we actually need and want here, right, to include any entertainment and leisure.” Port Wentworth, with a population of about 15,000, has a permit to draw 232,000 gallons a day from the Floridan aquifer. It uses about 200,000 gallons a day of that capacity. But the city sits in the state’s “red zone” where groundwater use has been ratcheted downward to protect the aquifer. “We can’t drill new wells or anything like that,” City Manager Steve Davis said. “So by no means will there be any groundwater used. It will be a surface water fix.” Port Wentworth supplements its groundwater supply with treated surface water it purchases from the city of Savannah. Port Wentworth could also use the 200,000 gallons a day of treated effluent from its wastewater treatment plant to cool a data center if need be, Davis said. But water usage wasn’t the residents’ only concern. Some cited data center electricity demands. “We know that the power grid is not sufficient to handle all the new developments of residential, commercial and industrial in our area right now,” Ginny Hines said. Others worried about noise. “Data centers create noise and air pollution from the massive cooling systems and backup generators,” resident Ray Rafalowski said. “These disrupt nearby residents’ sleep and health. Data centers create very few jobs, basically low wage janitor and maintenance positions. There is absolutely no benefit to the residents of Port Wentworth to bring a data center to our city.” Jeff Beauvais of the nonprofit One Hundred Miles raised concerns about what he sees as a hurried process. The ordinance was first introduced Nov. 20 and the full text available only since Friday. “Why rush passing a major ordinance like this during the busy holiday season in less than a month?” he asked. “It is not a recipe for success.” While the city had included some guardrails, the ordinance remained too permissive, Beauvais argued. “This approach is out of step with best practices six Georgia counties have already adopted considering data center ordinances that include specific development standards meant to limit the water use, energy use, visual and noise impacts, as well as the other environmental impacts that are associated,” he told the commission. “Port Wentworth should look to these local laws for guidance, and they will find that their law is sorely lacking in comparison.” A flyer from One Hundred Miles lists five counties that have passed moratoriums on data centers while they investigate further: Troup, Pike, Lamar, Clayton and Monroe. Another four counties — Lumpkin, Forsyth, Bartow and Douglas — have passed ordinances with additional requirements on data centers, with Dekalb currently developing its ordinance with community input. Port Wentworth does not have a signed agreement for a data center, Robichaux said. But he insisted they will be coming to the Savannah area. “We do know that they were looking for data centers in this region,” he said. “We’re one of the fastest growing regions in the country. Port Wentworth is in the top three fastest growing cities in Georgia. Pooler is right behind us. Hardeeville is the fastest growing city in South Carolina. South Effingham and Rincon are exploding, and all of these people use data. In your phones, in your homes, in your businesses, everywhere. Data is everywhere, so it is needed, it is going to come, somewhere.” Commissioner Patrick Saunders, a real estate agent, worried aloud about the effects of data centers on home values, likening them to a jail or a toxic waste dump. “So where they put these places by these industrial building areas no one’s gonna want to live here. And then all the people that live here, they’re stuck with their houses forever. I love where I live, but not if there’s a humming data center right across the street. So, and I think everybody agrees with that. We’re 28% industrial in this city. We’ve got plenty of industrial stuff. (The ordinance) needs to be more in-depth.” With Commissioner Sean Register drew applause when he recused himself from the vote because his work as a consultant has involved helping two municipalities that are looking at data centers. The remaining seven commissions agreed to reject the ordinance. After the vote, Port Wentworth Mayor-elect Tracy Saunders said got the outcome she wanted. “Today is the perfect example of how things are supposed to work. You get proposals. You submit information,’ she said. “Get feedback, and you listen to that feedback. And you could tell that today, everybody up there was listening, and they responded.” Beauvais, of One Hundred Miles, was looking ahead to Thursday. “The planning commission was unanimous and that this is not a strong enough ordinance, and the city council gets that recommendation,” he said. “And now it’s on the city council to table this and listen to the people.” The Tide brings regular notes and observations on news and events by The Current staff.

She'd come to city meetings before, to talk about the traffic, about the growth in the city, but had stopped because she felt like her complaints and concerns fell on deaf ears. But the proposed amendment to add data centers as an allowable use to the zoning ordinance that had suddenly appeared last-minute on the most recent city council agenda was important enough to prompt her return. ""I think if you open the door for something, even if it's a crack, the light will get in,"" Hughes said with a slight shake in her voice. ""They will come in, and they will take everything. If you don't set any standards, no one's going to want to come in. I stopped coming here because the people stop being listened to, so listen to us."" The ""they"" Hughes referenced were companies seeking to build a data center in the city of Port Wentworth. While leadership said they have no current site plan applications for data centers, residents made their displeasure to even the consideration of adding data centers to the zoning ordinances known at Monday afternoon's Planning Commission meeting. Their pleas didn't fall on deaf ears this time, because commissioners unanimously recommended city council deny defining and setting guidelines for data centers. The proliferation of these large climate-controlled buildings has been driven by the growth in cloud and high-performance computing for AI, online shopping, websites, apps and data storage, according to nonprofit Science for Georgia . They can use anywhere between 1 million and 5 million gallons of water a day to cool the services that store digital information , which causes enormous impacts to water and energy resources. There is also concern over the surge in electricity demand. Barclay’s research estimates that data centers will account for more than 9% of electricity consumption in the U.S. by 2030, up from 3.5% today. In Georgia, data centers are projected to take up 90% of Georgia’s new energy when it expands its energy grid by 2031, according to Georgia Power at a hearing in June. Science for Georgia estimates the state now has nearly 100 operating data centers. Is Georgia's economy slowing? What experts say about state's 'uncertainty' If expansion gets approved, Georgia Power agrees to save residents $8.50 a month in 2028 At the end of November, Mayor Gary North plus three gathered city councilmembers voted to add the last-minute item to the agenda and held the first reading at its regularly scheduled meeting on Nov. 20. Zoning ordinance amendments must go through two readings and a public hearing at city council to be approved. The second reading is slated for Dec. 18. Although City Attorney Scott Robichaux said that the city had been approached by partners to bring a data center to the city on Nov. 20, less than a month later on Dec. 15, he and City Manager Steve Davis said they did not have any site plans in front of them. ""This is not an approval of a data center,"" Robichaux said at the Dec. 15 Planning Commission meeting. ""This [amendment] just allows us to have rules to define what a data center is and put additional rules in place if someone wanted to bring one here."" When anything is undefined in the zoning ordinance, it falls under a discretionary decision about what it is, what use it is, what guidelines it has to follow and everything else, Robichaux said. The proposed amendment that was rushed through a first reading on Nov. 20 was bare bones, with only a definition for data centers and that it would be placed in the I-1, Industrial, Infrastructure and Transportation zone. Since then, more details have been added to the ordinance, such as requiring developers to go through the Development of Regional Impacts (DRI) process, which are designed to reveal and assess potential impacts of large-scale developments. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) adopted this review process for data centers in November, which went into effect on Dec. 1 5, meaning developers will have to make estimates of water and electricity use public. The process, however, applies to data centers of at least 500,000 square feet. ""They've got to show [Port Wentworth] the height and materials of walls and fences at the concept plan level,"" Robichaux said. ""They've got to show us the size and location of proposed utilities at that same point, normally stuff that would be required later on."" Despite Robichaux and Davis stressing that the proposed ordinance was just to set rules in place, residents were unmoved even though they understood the principle. Of the residents who spoke, some felt like there just didn't need to be guidelines at all, so developers wouldn't come. Others wanted the city to put a prohibition of data centers in place. Others thought the proposed ordinance just had no teeth. Ginny Hines said the city was going to let itself be kneecapped by a developer who was particularly overzealous. ""I completely understand needing and feeling the need to define data centers in the municipal code,"" said Amy Gutting. ""I only question how quickly this is moving, and if it is prohibitive enough to reflect and protect the community's interest to not have them here. I feel that it's not. So, that's my main concern. There's nothing preventing you from doing a moratorium while you figure out the language."" Troup, Pike, Lamar, Clayton and Monroe counties have passed moratoriums on data centers while they further look into them. Dekalb County is developing a data center ordinance that is more detailed. Port Wentworth Mayor-elect Tracy Saunders, who takes office next month; North Coast Advocate for 100 Miles Jeffery Beauvais and Councilmember Artlise Alston-Cone agreed, and also went up to the podium to question how quickly the process seemed to be moving. Beauvais encouraged commissioners to deny the ordinance as written, because it felt too permissive and to delay any consideration until next year after reviews of other cities' ordinances and community engagement have taken place. At minimum, he said the data center ordinance should: Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, claims that data centers are among the most efficient water users in the country, and that the industry is developing other techniques to cool the server's holding information. Google's data center in Douglasville uses recycled water for cooling needs. Davis also said that the city currently has the capability of reusing up to 2 million gallons of water right now. ""Our wastewater treatment plant is already made for this, and we're not using it,"" Davis said. ""We're discharging it now. If we actually get a real offer on a data center, we would be pushing for the use of reuse water."" Data centers bring significant capital investments, Diorio added, of hundreds of millions of dollars. In Georgia, the data center industry contributed $14.1 billion to labor income in 2023, according to information provided by the Data Center Coalition. “For every one job in a data center, six jobs are supported elsewhere in the economy, nationally,” Diorio said. “They rely on construction workers to build it, and when they’re up and running they rely on local electricians, plumbers, pipe fitters, etc., to continuously service the facilities.” Georgia Power faces public scrutiny over grid expansion to support data centers Fire Chief and Commission member Lance Moore said that if the ordinance was in place, it would at least give them a starting place to impose restrictions if they wanted. ""Even if it's not this [ordinance], we need one,"" Moore said. Commission member Patrick Donovan was against putting the ordinance in from the start of the conversation, saying the ordinance needed to be way more in depth for a city that is already zoned nearly 30% industrial. The planning commission unanimously recommended denial to the city council after little discussion. Sean Register recused himself, due to his involvement as an economic development consultant assisting two other municipal governments that are currently looking at data centers. ""I think today is proof that the process still works,"" Saunders said. ""There were lots of people who had questions, who had strong emotions, and the board listened and voted accordingly."" The final public hearing will be 7 p.m., Dec. 18, at 7224 GA Highway 21. Saunders said that she hoped the council would ""read the room."" ""Data is everywhere,"" said Davis after all of the comments. ""We do know that they're looking for data centers in the region, as one of the fastest growing regions in the country. All of these people use data. It's needed, so a data center is definitely going to come, it's going to come somewhere. It's just where. But it's coming to the Savannah region.""

Data centers are not mentioned in Athens’ 25-year-old zoning code, but when the first application for one off Old Hull Road came in, “the decision was made that data centers would be interpreted as heavy manufacturing,” Planning Director Bruce Lonnee told the ACC Planning Commission Dec. 11. That applicant decided not to follow through, but one data center was built off Voyles Road in a light industrial zone because applicants Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light are not subject to local zoning laws, Lonnee said. Most recently, Reynolds Capital, the company that started Athena Studios, has been exploring converting that facility into a data center. In justifying the heavy industry classification, Lonnee pointed to their heavy water usage, truck traffic and the need to store large amounts of fuel for backup generators—potentially hundreds of thousands of gallons. “That amount of fuel being stored onsite is atypical for anything but a heavy industrial use,” he said. The local government cannot regulate power usage, but is using daily electrical needs as a proxy for size. Under the proposed regulations, data centers under 2.5 megawatts could be built by right, going up to five megawatts if the applicant agrees to use “purple pipes,” or reclaimed nonpotable water, for cooling and renewable energy for backup generators. Data centers larger than five megawatts would need a special use permit approved by the county commission. For comparison, one megawatt could power all the homes in Winterville, and a typical grocery store uses three megawatts, according to Lonnee. As for water usage, an evaporative cooling system can consume up to nine million gallons of water per day. The Athena Studios data center would use a closed-loop system, which consumes about 5,000–50,000 gallons a day, or could use a chemical coolant instead of water. However, closed-loop systems require more electricity to cool the water instead of using evaporation. Lonnee said that planners want to strike a balance between stopping data centers that might be harmful to the community without getting in the way of smaller ones that might be beneficial to UGA research or existing manufacturers. Not all of them are giant facilities built for AI computing or cloud storage. Some are the size of refrigerators. “There are data centers you pass by every day and probably never noticed,” he said. “They were once server rooms and morphed into something else.” But others create noise and vibrations that bother people living nearby. On Pittard Road, residents had finally gotten on city water after decades of being poisoned by industrial chemicals leaching into wells when construction started on the Georgia Power/Atlanta Gas Light data center. “This felt like another message that our lives don’t matter,” Tawana Mattox told the planning commission. In January, the planning commission is scheduled to send the regulations on to the county commission for final approval as soon as Feb. 2.

New modeling from the report, “Impacts of Projected Data Center Growth and Emerging Uncertainties on Power Demand in the Southeast” , finds utilities in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina are planning for data-center-driven electricity demand growth that has a roughly 0.2% chance of actually occurring. These states are facing a massive proposed expansion of methane gas infrastructure and power plants to support data centers. The report raises serious questions about the assumptions used to justify that buildout. Greenlink Analytics and Science for Georgia developed an independent data center load forecast for the Southeast, using credible national and global market data on data center growth, Monte Carlo simulations, and compared this with utilities’ projections. The analysis demonstrates that utilities are betting on the highly unlikely, top end of the range projections. This analysis, which utilized conservative assumptions with regards to any future technological efficiency improvements, shows likely data center load growth in the Southeast to be approximately 2.4-6.7 GW over the next 5-6 years, while utilities are planning for over 10 GW—a scenario that is above 99.7% of the 100,000 of our simulations. The report’s second set of simulations, which assumes further potential energy efficiency gains for data centers from new and emerging technologies, forecasts that the utilities’ aggregate growth projection is even less likely: a 1-in-8,000 chance. “There is a lot that is still unclear when it comes to the future of data center energy demand, but the evidence for massive demand growth that would justify this much capacity expansion from utilities just isn’t there,” said Kavin Manickaraj, Chief Data Scient ist, Greenlink Analytics. “Our simulations show that even without any computational advancements the industry expects, there is about a 1 in 500 chance that we would need to build 10 GW of energy capacity throughout the Southeast to account for data centers.” “ Over the course of researching this report, the utility estimates for load growth have only risen. Just last week, Georgia Power and the Georgia Public Service Commission staff agreed to a 10 GW expansion for Georgia alone . Yet, as our report shows, during the same time subject matter experts’ estimates have gone down,” said Amy Sharma, PhD, Executive Director, Science for Georgia. “This is a call to pump the brakes and take into account multiple inputs, before we burden the southeast with expensive stranded assets – assets that ratepayers will be accountable to pay for.” “This report is a sanity check on the pressure coming from all directions that more gas is urgently needed to support data center growth. It’s important that we slow down and look at the evidence that not only is there less projected demand than these utilities want us to believe, but there’s also significant downsides to building all the utilities’ proposed gas power plants and pipelines that will end up as expensive stranded assets on the backs of Southern ratepayers,” said Megan Gibson, Senior Attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “If utilities are allowed to run wild overbuilding gas infrastructure for power demand that likely will not exist, Southern communities will end up paying the price with their pocketbooks and health.” Utilities and pipeline companies across the Southeastern United States are planning significant, long-term expansions of natural gas infrastructure over the next 15 years, with projected data center growth cited as a primary driver. Given utilities’ track record of over forecasting, and this additional analysis, policymakers, regulators, and communities should treat aggressive projections around ‘data center’ demand, and resulting plans for an extreme gas buildout, with healthy skepticism and demand more transparent, realistic planning. These findings echo another report commissioned by SELC earlier this year demonstrating the risk of duplicate proposals inflating load projections and a shortage in chips and showing that projected data center buildout is virtually impossible to achieve.

The proposed Project Turbo was set to be built on 119 acres on O’Kelly Road in Gainesville, but residents raised concerns about the project’s impact on water usage and traffic congestion. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks ] “I’m very happy they pulled the plug,” said neighbor Kerri McCoy, expressing relief that the developer dropped the plans. Residents were worried that the data center would use about 225,000 gallons of water per day to cool computer equipment, potentially compromising public water availability. At a commission meeting Thursday night, residents learned that the developers had rescinded their special use permit for the data center and would seek a light industrial zoning change instead. TRENDING STORIES: STORY 1 STORY 2 STORY 3 Despite the change in plans, many residents remain skeptical about the developer’s intentions for the property. “We don’t have the infrastructure for it,” said McCoy. A representative for the developer stated that the decision was due to insufficient fact-finding and education about modern data centers at the commission and staff level.

In November, community members attended a meeting, where many opposed the idea of data centers. They were also heated when DeKalb County leaders planned to consider new regulations for data centers at a zoning meeting five months after imposing a temporary moratorium. Residents demanded more time to discuss the issue. Data centers are facilities that house servers and infrastructure for computing, data storage, and the transmission of applications and services. The county currently has two existing data centers: a 3,350-square-foot facility operated by DC Blox Atlanta and an 88,000-square-foot facility owned by Lincoln Rackhouse. When residents spoke during the meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 16, their stance did not change. Many were still opposed to it and called for more time for the moratorium; some said it should be extended to one year. After residents spoke, the commissioners decided to extend the moratorium until June 2026. They pushed back the vote for rules and regulations to January 2026.

Concerns about data center growth are emerging across the state, including in Port Wentworth, where city leaders are considering zoning changes that could allow such facilities. Georgia Power is asking state regulators to approve what it calls one of the largest electricity expansions in Georgia history, citing surging demand from data centers that run around the clock to support streaming, banking, online shopping and artificial intelligence. The Georgia Public Service Commission is scheduled to vote Dec. 19 on whether to allow the utility to spend about $15 billion over the next six years to increase electric system capacity by roughly 50%. Georgia Power says the proposal would help meet “unprecedented growth” while keeping power affordable. The company says large energy users would pay higher rates under the plan, which it argues would reduce the average residential bill by about $102 a year after new base rates are set in 2028. Data centers house computer servers that store and process online information and typically require significant electricity and constant cooling to prevent equipment from overheating. Goldman Sachs Research has forecast that global power demand from data centers will rise 165% from 2023 to 2030. TRENDING STORIES Critics, however, say customers could be left carrying long-term costs and risks, especially if the plan leads to additional fossil fuel infrastructure. “The real question at hand is who benefits from the growth — and who bears the cost of the growth,” said Alicia Johnson, the Democratic commissioner-elect for the PSC. Johnson will not take office until after the vote. She said the proposal warrants closer scrutiny to ensure Georgians are not “saddled” with higher bills and added risk. Johnson also warned that building more fossil fuel assets could lock customers into paying for them for decades, limiting flexibility and future clean energy options.
